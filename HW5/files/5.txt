Cristiano Ronaldo left Manchester United by mutual agreement with immediate effect, as he said the time is right to seek a new challenge. Recently, the club and he have been embroiled in a legal battle.
The club suspended the 37-year-old player when Ronaldo refused to come off the bench last month, and then, he gave a TV interview about his frustrations. He explained he felt betrayed, and he had no respect for the club’s manager Ten Hag, who largely used him as a substitute. Last month, Ronaldo refused to go onto the pitch against Tottenham Hotspur, and he walked down the tunnel with minutes of the match to play.
Following years of protests from fans, Manchester United’s owners are considering selling the club. The Glazers bought the club in 2005 for 790 million pounds; however, Manchester United hasn’t won a Premier League Title since 2013, and the team struggled to find a long-term manager after Sir Alex Ferguson retired. Multiple protests have happened in recent years, and some games had to be postponed because of them. If someone else buys Manchester United, the expectation is it will go to US investors.
