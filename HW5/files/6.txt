A very big aquarium is in Berlin, Germany. It is inside a hotel. The aquarium holds one million liters of water.
On Friday, the aquarium breaks. All the water pours onto a road. 300 people must leave the building. Broken glass hurts two people. Luckily, the event happens early in the morning. Only a few people are around. 1,500 tropical fish are in the tank. They all die.
The first reports say that low temperatures cause the event. Police do not know the truth. They must still find the reason.
