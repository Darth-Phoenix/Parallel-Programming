Swiss tennis star Roger Federer announced that he would retire after next week’s Laver Cup in London, UK.
Many people regard Federer as the greatest male player to swing a tennis racket because he has won 20 Grand Slam titles. With his artistry and grace, he dominated men’s tennis for years. In 2003, he won his first grand slam title at Wimbledon, and he took the sport to new levels.
After losing at last year’s Wimbledon, Federer planned to play another match, but a knee injury stopped him. However, his fans still believed that he could return for one last golden farewell.
In his latest Instagram post, Federer said that at 41 years old, he’d played more than 1,500 matches over 24 years. Tennis was his lifelong passion, but he recognized that the time came to end his competitive career.
Federer’s career includes eight Wimbledon titles, five US Open titles, six Australian crowns and a single French Open title. He also holds the record for 237 consecutive weeks as world number one.
