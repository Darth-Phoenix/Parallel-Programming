Swedish scientists do an experiment. They put a cloth on a glacier. The glacier is the Helags Glacier in the north of Sweden.
All glaciers in the world are melting. This happens because the planet is getting warmer. Scientists are thinking of ways on how to stop it.
They put a cloth on the top of the Helags Glacier in summer. The cloth stops the sun. It keeps the glacier cold. Scientists save at least 3.5 meters of ice. The ice does not melt.
The melting of glaciers is a serious problem. Scientists believe that more people know about the problem now.
