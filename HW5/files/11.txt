Thousands of cosplayers and anime fans flocked to the annual Anime Festival Asia (AFA) in Singapore; people held the festival for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic.
AFA began in 2008, and itâ€™s the largest and most followed Japanese pop culture event in Southeast Asia. Anime is a sub-culture from Japan, which has continued to thrive and grow internationally in recent years, due to its vast online presence and supportive participants. In 2019, the three-day convention attracted 120,000 attendees, and organizers expect to reach at least the same numbers for this year.
For many cosplayers, the event feels like a meeting of old friends because they are in constant online contact with each other.
