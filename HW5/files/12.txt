Across the world, a summer of drought revealed long-submerged relics.
The Dinosaur Valley State Park in Texas, US, has discovered dinosaur footprints; they were preserved for millions of years under layers of sediment, clay, and limestone. The drought shrunk the Paluxy River, which revealed the tracks from millions of years ago, and then, rains submerged them once again.
The park claimed that the footprints were over 113 million years old, so they may be the longest tracks made by a single dinosaur in North America.
Park officials said that many footprints appeared and disappeared throughout the park, depending on the weather. These particular footprints were last visible 20 years ago.
