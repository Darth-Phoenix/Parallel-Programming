ntil the 3rd century AD, the town of Baia was the most coveted destination for wealthy Roman citizens, senators, and emperors.
Now, itâ€™s hidden beneath the sand and pebbles in the waters of the Gulf of Pozzuoli, just a few kilometers from Naples, Italy, and the only residents are fish and seahorses.
The slow movement of land from volcanic activity caused the land to submerge, and in 1969, divers discovered the ruins of two marble statues by chance. About 15,000 divers, snorkelers, and tourists visit the site all year round to travel back in time and swim through ancient streets, mosaics, statues, and the remains of a seaside resort.
Over the years, archeologists have moved some of the ancient objects above the sea to protect them from rock-eating plants and animals, strong tides, and thieves. However, the archeologists have placed copies of the originals underwater so that divers can experience the city as it was 2,000 years ago.
