Two elderly men were walking down an escalator when somebody shouted, “Free burgers!” The men, as well as others, wanted the burgers, and the men started to run up the escalator the wrong way.
It was not easy for them to get to the top. They tripped and fell several times. The people at the Polish shopping centre filmed and watched the two men. After they finally reached the top, they received cheers from the crowd.
